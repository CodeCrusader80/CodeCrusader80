- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeCrusader80 or Mathieu for close friends, both work for me.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, search, programming all the web !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, CoreML, HTML, CSS, React and Pyhton yes it's a lot but why not ?
- 💞️ In search of collaboration on various projects, I am not picky and am always eager to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me in my GitHub, my Twitter : https://twitter.com/theunknowman_80 or LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-moutarde-3a6a00180/ I also have a CodePen if you want to take a look at some creations I make in HTML, CSS, or even JS just right here: https://codepen.io/CodeCrusader80. 
- I am still working on my portfolio project to provide you with additional means to contact me.
