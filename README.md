I'm looking for contributions in all areas, after all that's how we grow up so don't hesitate!<br>Very curious by nature and especially with tech, frameworks, I am very attentive to novelties and lately obviously AI which fascinates me to the highest degree.<br> My story is not necessarily very different from most other devs, passionate about tech since I was little, I've always had a certain attraction for code and everything that surrounds it. Following some turbulence in my professional life, I questioned many things and in particular what I really wanted in my life and what was necessary for my well-being, after many hours of reflection the verdict did not come been able to distract me from this path that now wishes to explore to find a better balance and fulfillment through my work. Do not hesitate to let me know what you consider necessary if among my projects you notice any errors or possible improvements to propose, after all it is a discipline that requires constant learning ðŸ˜‰

<h4>Short Desc</h4>
<p>This project consists of a presentation page for a site specializing in the Metaverse universe. Made from a tutorial on YouTube from the JS Mastery channel, which allowed me to familiarize myself with NextJS as well as Framer Motion. This site also uses TailwindCSS for layout and responsiveness. To get an overview of the project simply click on the illustration image below</p>

<h4>Short Desc</h4>
<p>A portfolio using the power of 3D to highlight skills while taking advantage of framer motion to manage text display animations in a quite friendly way. All running under React obviously and Vite for the build. To begin to familiarize myself with interesting tools, emailJS was used to design the form (well for this first test it is obviously not active).</p>
